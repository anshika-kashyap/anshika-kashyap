# Note

Available For Freelance! I am a self-taught Brand Identity Designer. If you are open to fresh perspectives and honest efforts, I would love to contribute through my visuals.

# About Me

I am a Brand Identity Designer, a Certified Data Analyst and a Final Year College Student, pursuing Bachelor Of Commerce. I enjoy working with data but my real interest lies in design.

Whenever I work with data, it's based on logic and structures, but my design is driven by my raw intuition and visual experimentation. Designing is what I am doing currently and actively as a freelancer, and data is something I use in each step of design.

I would like to say that data and design looks good when blended, but separately, they tell stories no one wants you to know!

For my Data Analytics skills, you can see my Popular Repositories. For my Designing skills, you can see my [design portfolio](https://sites.google.com/view/anshikakashyap-designportfolio/about).
